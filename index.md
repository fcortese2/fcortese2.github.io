#### GraphIt - Unity Tool
GraphIt is a Unity tool that allows developers to display graphs in the unity editor directly. This is especially useful if the developers want to visualize large arrays full of data only in the editor, without losing any performance in the final/development build. This can be handy with regards to balancing, spotting of major bugs and triggers to these bugs, errors in underlying logic, etc... It is not aimed to be a replacement with regards to the recording of historical data and post-playtest data analysis, but rather as an in-engine playtest data debugger/visualizer.
